# Travel-Review-Site-Project
An MVC application that uses multiple models and foreign keys to model a relationship, mimicking a Travel Review site.
Overview
For this project you will be developing an MVC application that uses multiple models and foreign keys to model a relationship. You have the choice to develop either a Technology Review site or a Travel Review site.

You should have at least two models and a foreign key relationship. You should be able to view the styled home page, click a review and view a styled detail page.

After your app is created populate the Categories table with at least 3 categories, and your Reviews table with at least 5 mock reviews.
### Required Tasks
